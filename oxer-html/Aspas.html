                The rise of hero of LOUD comes to an end. Is he renewing his contract with LOUD or this is the farewell
            </h1>
            <p class="resize-text">
                The Grand Final of Valorant Champions 2022 showcased a clash between the brazilians from LOUD and the American team OPTC. After the former's victory, Aspas, the duelist of the team, let out some of his contract to the viewers stating that next year is the last year for him during an interview.

            <p class="resize-text">It is worth noting that Erick "aspas" Santos is one of the most renowned figures in the Valorant esports scene. The young 20-year-old duelist is considered one of the best in his role globally, which he proved by winning last year's world championship. Although the current season went quite well for the Brazilians, finishing in 3rd place at Valorant Champions 2023 and 2nd at LOCK//IN São Paulo, Erick has decided to part ways with his team, as we covered in our article.

                After this, the game community eagerly anticipated new information about the star player's potential new home. Rumors circulated online that he might re-sign with the Brazilian national team or move to another region and join Bleed eSports. Today, it became known that in the next VCT season, aspas will likely be playing under the flag of the Argentinian team Leviatan.
                
                For them, the current season seemed rather unsuccessful; the team finished LOCK//IN São Paulo in the 5-8th spots, the regional VCT 2023: Americas League in 5th place. And in the Last Chance Qualifier in the American region, they landed in 2nd place, consequently missing out on the world championship. After the disappointing season, the organization said goodbye to their duelist Vicente "Tacolilla" Compagnon, and as of today, that "position" remains vacant. We remind our readers that these are just rumors, and a verbal agreement doesn't guarantee that aspas will definitely join the Argentinian club. Keep following our portal to find out whether the rumors are debunked or confirmed</p>
