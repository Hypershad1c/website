                F*** the haters, respect my f***** name, I'm the best player in this game" - Demon1 couldn't hold back his emotions after winning the World Championship            </h1>
            <p class="resize-text">
                The Grand Final of Valorant Champions 2023 showcased a clash between the Americans from Evil Geniuses and the Singaporean team Paper Rex. After the former's victory, Demon1, the duelist of the team, let out some expletives towards all the viewers and haters during an interview.            </p>

            <p class="resize-text">Max "Demon1" Mazanov is known for his eccentric behavior throughout the current championship. In many matches, he taunted over the bodies of his opponents, shooting and jumping on them. Moreover, this isn't the first time he has spoken out obscenely during interviews. Earlier, he said he doesn't care what people say about him or how haters react to his actions during matches. This provoked the wrath of Alfajer from Fnatic, who warned Demon1 to watch his back when they meet in a match. You can read more about the conflict in our article.

                Unfortunately, the paths of the teams didn't cross in the championship; the "Oranges" left the tournament while the "Geniuses" emerged as its winners. After this, Demon1 took to the stage and declared himself as the best player in Valorant and that everyone should respect him.
                
                Is Demon1 really the best player in Valorant?
                
                In the current World Championship, Demon1 indeed stood out as the best player. He set a new record for kills in a match, achieving 101 frags, made a stunning ace when he was down to just 5 health, and impressed viewers with his vast character pool. We delved into why Demon1 is the best player of the championship; you can read more about it below.</p>
